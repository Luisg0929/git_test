        <h1>Blog Article of My Ideas</h1>
        <h1>The Plan! (April 2 2024)</h1>
            <p>
                I want to make a website that will serve as a project that I can use 
                things like showing my youtube channel projects etc. Emphasis on the 
                <em>projects</em> portion of all this
            </p>
            <p>
                I think the <strong>important</strong> part of this process will be
                being able to do everything I am saying. Perhaps it will be Daunting but oh well who cares 
                I must go on!!
            </p>
